This is a tutorial on installing the polkadex node with parachain in a new environment. It's designed that you create a new user so you are not root right away, verify it can login and run sudo commands, than we block root from logging in, we define our firewall to open up ports for grafana and node exporter plus for solochain and any other connections our server creates and establishes first. After that we install sshguard and whitelist our home ip so we dont have issues, then its designed to run the parachain as a cmd line process let it fully sync up, than create its service file and restart it as a service, than we run the solochain let it fully sync up, create its service file and restart it up, than we install prometheus, node exporter, nginx, alertmanager and grafana so we can have a web interface that only allows our ip to view it ie http://serverip:3000/ and also notifications through gmail if the cpu load is high or process isnt communicating to notify you by email.
